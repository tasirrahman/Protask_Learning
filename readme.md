# ProTask â€“ Unified Task Management System

**ProTask** is a cross-platform task management application built for individuals and teams to efficiently organize, manage, and track their tasks. This project is designed for learning and experimentation with modern frontend, backend, and backend-as-a-service technologies.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

ProTask includes:

- A **web-based dashboard** using **React** and **Next.js**
- A **mobile application** using **Flutter**
- Integration with **MongoDB**, **Firebase**, and **Supabase** for data handling and authentication

The project focuses on production-level architecture, secure code practices, and clean state management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Objectives

- Develop scalable, secure, and maintainable code using modern software engineering principles.
- Use **Redux** (React/Next.js) and **Provider/BLoC** (Flutter) for robust state management.
- Set up a modular **Node.js** backend (for MongoDB) with secure REST APIs.
- Experiment with **Firebase** and **Supabase** for real-time sync and BaaS learning.
- Compare BaaS platforms based on real-world implementations.
