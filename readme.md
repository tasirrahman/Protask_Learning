# ProTask ‚Äì Unified Task Management System

**ProTask** is a cross-platform task management application built for individuals and teams to efficiently organize, manage, and track their tasks. This project is designed for learning and experimentation with modern frontend, backend, and backend-as-a-service technologies.

---

## üìå Project Description

ProTask includes:

- A **web-based dashboard** using **React** and **Next.js**
- A **mobile application** using **Flutter**
- Integration with **MongoDB** and **Supabase** for data handling and authentication

The project focuses on production-level architecture, secure code practices, and clean state management.

---

## üéØ Primary Objectives

- Develop scalable, secure, and maintainable code using modern software engineering principles
- Use **Redux** (React/Next.js) and **Provider/BLoC** (Flutter) for robust state management
- Set up a modular **Node.js** backend (for MongoDB) with secure REST APIs
- Implement **Supabase** for real-time synchronization and backend-as-a-service functionality
- Evaluate BaaS approaches through practical implementation

## üìä Architecture Overview

ProTask implements a hybrid backend approach:
- **Custom Node.js Backend**: For core data operations with MongoDB
- **Supabase BaaS**: For real-time features, authentication, and storage

This dual approach allows for learning and comparing different backend strategies within a single project.
