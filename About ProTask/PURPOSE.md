# 🚀 Project Development Journey: ProTask – Unified Task Management System

## 🧭 Purpose & Vision

I am developing **ProTask**, a task management web and mobile application, as a self-driven initiative to:

- Explore how far I can **apply my knowledge** in full-stack development.
- Evaluate my technical proficiency in **React**, **Next.js**, and **Flutter**.
- Test my ability to design, integrate, and switch between multiple backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platforms like **Firebase**, **Supabase**, and custom backend with **MongoDB + Node.js**.
- Validate my skills in building secure, modular, scalable, and production-ready SaaS applications across platforms.

> 💡 This project is not just about building an app—it's about **measuring my capability** to plan, build, integrate, and deliver a complete, cross-platform solution using modern frameworks and databases.

## 🛠️ Development Stack & Why I'm Using It

### 🔷 Frontend

| Framework   | Usage                              | Reason for Choice                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **React**   | Web UI                              | For reusable components, fast rendering, and ecosystem      |
| **Next.js** | Web routing & SSR                   | For routing, API routes, SEO support, and file structure    |
| **Flutter** | Mobile (Android & iOS)              | For cross-platform UI and native-like performance           |

### 🔶 Backend / BaaS

| Service         | Usage                         | Reason for Choice                                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MongoDB + Node.js** | Custom backend logic         | To test my full-stack backend capabilities using REST and JWT       |
| **Firebase**     | Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB | For testing rapid integration, real-time listeners, and FCM        |
| **Supabase**     | Auth, Realtime Postgres       | For learning SQL-based BaaS with built-in RLS and web SDK features |

## 🧪 Project Goals

### 🎯 What I'm Trying to Achieve
- Build one feature-rich task manager using all available tools in my stack.
- Evaluate how well I can manage **code structure, state management, and modularity**.
- Analyze the **trade-offs between Firebase, Supabase, and MongoDB** in a real scenario.
- Push myself to meet production-level coding and architectural standards.

### 🔍 What I’ll Be Assessing
- Can I structure code to be **maintainable** and **scalable**?
- How do I manage **state, data flow, and async logic** across platforms?
- How confident am I in implementing **secure auth and CRUD systems**?
- How flexible and efficient am I in adopting different **data layers and services**?

## 📈 Learning Focus Areas

1. **State Management**:
   - Using Redux for React/Next.js
   - Using Provider and BLoC for Flutter

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implementing secure login with JWT (MongoDB)
   - Firebase and Supabase Auth flows

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Firestore vs. Realtime Postgres vs. MongoDB + REST

4. **UI/UX**:
   - Cross-platform responsive UI
   - Mobile-native experience (Flutter)
   - Web dashboard design (React/Next.js + Tailwind)

5. **Security**:
   - Token-based auth
   - Role-based access control (Supabase RLS)
   - Secure API communication

---

## 💼 End Goal

This is a **learning-focused, skill-auditing project** that will serve as a personal benchmark of:

- My **current capabilities**
- My ability to **execute a complete idea** into a functional SaaS
- My readiness to lead or contribute to a real-world, multi-platform application

> 🔄 I may revisit this project later to reflect on improvements, performance tuning, or rearchitecture based on experience gained over time.

## ✅ Summary

**ProTask** is more than a task manager—it's a **self-assessment engine** for me to push the boundaries of what I know and identify what I need to learn next. This journey blends creativity, logic, design, and execution into one focused mission.
