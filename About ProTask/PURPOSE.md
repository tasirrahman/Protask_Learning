# 🚀 Project Development Journey: ProTask – Unified Task Management System

## 🧭 Purpose & Vision

I am developing **ProTask**, a task management web and mobile application, as a self-driven initiative to:

- Explore how far I can **apply my knowledge** in full-stack development.
- Evaluate my technical proficiency in **React**, **Next.js**, and **Flutter**.
- Test my ability to design and integrate backend solutions with **Supabase** and custom backend with **MongoDB + Node.js**.
- Validate my skills in building secure, modular, scalable, and production-ready SaaS applications across platforms.

> 💡 This project is not just about building an app—it's about **measuring my capability** to plan, build, integrate, and deliver a complete, cross-platform solution using modern frameworks and databases.

## 🛠️ Development Stack & Why I'm Using It

### 🔷 Frontend

| Framework   | Usage                              | Reason for Choice                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **React**   | Web UI                              | For reusable components, fast rendering, and ecosystem      |
| **Next.js** | Web routing & SSR                   | For routing, API routes, SEO support, and file structure    |
| **Flutter** | Mobile (Android & iOS)              | For cross-platform UI and native-like performance           |

### 🔶 Backend / BaaS

| Service         | Usage                         | Reason for Choice                                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MongoDB + Node.js** | Custom backend logic         | To test my full-stack backend capabilities using REST and JWT       |
| **Supabase**     | Auth, Realtime Postgres       | For learning SQL-based BaaS with built-in RLS and web SDK features |

> Note: As an experienced Firebase developer, I've deliberately excluded Firebase from this project to focus on expanding my knowledge with other technologies.

## 🧪 Project Goals

### 🎯 What I'm Trying to Achieve
- Build one feature-rich task manager using selected tools in my stack.
- Evaluate how well I can manage **code structure, state management, and modularity**.
- Analyze the **trade-offs between Supabase and MongoDB** in a real scenario.
- Push myself to meet production-level coding and architectural standards.

### 🔍 What I'll Be Assessing
- Can I structure code to be **maintainable** and **scalable**?
- How do I manage **state, data flow, and async logic** across platforms?
- How confident am I in implementing **secure auth and CRUD systems**?
- How flexible and efficient am I in adopting different **data layers and services**?

## 📈 Learning Focus Areas

1. **State Management**:
   - Using Redux for React/Next.js
   - Using Provider and BLoC for Flutter

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implementing secure login with JWT (MongoDB)
   - Supabase Auth flows

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Realtime Postgres vs. MongoDB + REST

4. **UI/UX**:
   - Cross-platform responsive UI
   - Mobile-native experience (Flutter)
   - Web dashboard design (React/Next.js + Tailwind)

5. **Security**:
   - Token-based auth
   - Role-based access control (Supabase RLS)
   - Secure API communication

---

## 💼 End Goal

This is a **learning-focused, skill-auditing project** that will serve as a personal benchmark of:

- My **current capabilities** with newer technologies
- My ability to **execute a complete idea** into a functional SaaS
- My readiness to lead or contribute to a real-world, multi-platform application

> 🔄 I may revisit this project later to reflect on improvements, performance tuning, or rearchitecture based on experience gained over time.

## ✅ Summary

**ProTask** is more than a task manager—it's a **self-assessment engine** for me to push the boundaries of what I know and identify what I need to learn next. While I've already mastered Firebase in previous projects, this journey focuses on expanding my expertise with Supabase and custom MongoDB solutions, blending creativity, logic, design, and execution into one focused mission.
